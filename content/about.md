## Who dis?

`$ whoami`

Im s0up4200/soup and this is my personal encyclopedia. Feel free to use it.
Im interested in servers, seedboxes, security and privacy. This site will be my personal notebook consisting of useful stuff I learn on my way.

I'm 30-something and got a two-year old daughter and a boy on the way.
I enjoy football and Fantasy Premier League.

## Volunteer work

I'm helping maintaining the docs for [autobrr](https://autobrr.com) - the modern autodl-irssi replacement.
I also try to help out whenever I can in various media/privsec related Discord and Matrix servers. It's not much.

## People that I learn and take inspiration from

In alphabetical order:`bp,brettpetch,gabe,kyles,liara,trash,ze0s`

## Why not just make a Github repo for this?

I wanted to try out Hugo, and I needed some content to put in it.

## This website

`$ whois r4tio.dev`

Static HTML and CSS website powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).   
A hardened theme called [hugo-WonderMod](https://github.com/Wonderfall/hugo-WonderMod) was chosen. Designed with strong CSP headers in mind - featuring removal of inline JavaScript and using pure CSS. WonderMod is a fork of an original theme called [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod).
