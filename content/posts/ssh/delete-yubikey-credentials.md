## What do we need?

```bash
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:yubico/stable
sudo apt update
sudo apt install yubikey-manager
```

## Requirements

Your YubiKey must have at least firmware 5.2.x. You can check this to open the YubiKey Manager app. If your YubiKey is lower than 5.2.x, then you canâ€™t make use of this and you need to do a complete reset of your YubiKey.

## Procedure

- Type `ykman fido list` and enter your PIN to get a list of the credentials that are stored in your YubiKey.
- If you know the credential that you want to delete, type `ykman fido delete [credential]` and enter your PIN.
- Press Y to delete the credential.
- Type `ykman fido list` to check if the credential has been deleted.
